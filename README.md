Developing a simple C shell

**Hello and thank you for visiting our C shell project! This project is a simple implementation of a Unix shell written in C.**

## Features
This shell offers a variety of common Unix shell functions. 
You can use 'cd' to change directories, 'pwd' to display the current working directory, and 'exit' to exit the shell. You can also run run commands with arguments as well as executing background tasks.

## Limitations
Advanced features are not supported by our shell implementation due to its simplicity.

## Contribution
Any contribution to the project is welcome. You can submit a pull request or open an issue if you find any bugs or have suggestions for how to enhance the shell.
